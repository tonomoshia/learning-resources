# Contributing Guide

These resources will be used in classrooms around the world to teach essential job skills.

We're collecting free training resources that can be used as curriculum for courses. In particular, we're making these materials available for use by housing-first job training programs for the homeless, but there's no reason not to use them in a regular school, or just to teach yourself a new skill. Everybody's welcome.

Please read [Fighting Poverty with Code](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/fighting-poverty-with-code-d1ed3ebd982d) and [The Cure for Homelessness](https://medium.com/end-homelessness/the-cure-for-homelessness-83ef0d621c71) to learn how this project got started.

## Order

Keep the content in learning order. It's a learning track, expertly curated by you (and a few friends).


## Quality Standard

We're looking for only the best of the best material. We're not trying to collect every free resource available in the world. That's Google's job. Our job is to make it easy for instructors to cherry pick a custom track that can easily compete with the top schools in the world. So please, don't try to add your latest blog post unless you really are one of the world-leading experts in your field.

If you think one of the existing resources could be replaced with something better, but you're not sure what that is yet, please [nominate it for replacement](https://github.com/jshomes/learning-resources/issues/new?title=[Replace?]). Copy and paste the item that needs replacing in the issue body.

### How do I know if it's OK to submit other people's content?

Ask yourself:

* "Would an industry expert submit this?"
* "Is this topic covered **better** by one of the other resources listed with the same hashtag?"

Remember, we're trying to create a cohesive curriculum. If there's already a better resource that teaches the same topic, that knowledge is already covered, so there's no need for you to submit something else.

But if you know that what you're submitting is a **better resource**, please contribute! We'll always welcome a better resource.


### How do I know if it's OK to submit my own content?

The "other people's content" guidelines still apply, along with:

* Do you teach at a highly respected school known to produce the world's best talent?
* Do you get invited to speak at major industry conferences a lot?
* Have you been published by one of the top industry publishers?
* Does your blog attract 100,000+ unique pageviews?
* Do you have more than 10k social media followers, and share primarily related content?

If you answered yes to at least three questions, go ahead and submit content that you produced.


## What if I'm not sure?

Open [an issue](https://github.com/jshomes/learning-resources/issues/new?title=[Please%20review]) and ask for an expert to review your contribution. Make sure the text, `[Please review]` appears in the title.


## What kind of content should I contribute?

We're primarily interested in a few types of content. You'll tell us what kind of content you're contributing by adding a hashtag at the end - like Twitter or Facebook.

* Video Shorter is better. 5-15 minutes works best. **#video**
* Long Video. Is your video over 15 minutes? Use hashtag: **#long_video**
* Book. Only add books that are available for free online. **#book**
* Article. Blog post? Book excerpt. Paper? The hashtag you want is **#article**
* Tutorial. A tutorial is a mix of text content and instructions for the reader to follow. **#tutorial**
* Exercises. Just like tutuorials, but exercises tell the student when something is wrong and let them try to fix it. e.g. [learnrx](http://jhusain.github.io/learnrx/) **#exercises**
* Project. A resource that describes a project for a student and lets the student complete it. **#project**
* Game. A game designed to teach the student how to do something. **#game**
* Infographic. A graphical visualization of information, somtimes connecting several data sets to reveal a larger picture. **#infographic**
* Community. An online place for students to meet other people interested in the topic so they can learn from each other. **#community**
* News. A resource that lets the student track current developments about the topic. **#news**
* Collection. An expert-curated collection of resources for a particular topic (like this one!). **#collection**
* Course. A full course curriculum, typically put together for an educational organization such as a university, or online school. **#course**
